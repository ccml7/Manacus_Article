**Table S1:** Information about ornithological collections visited to obtain morphological data of M. manacus in Colombia. See supplementary file for detailed measures of each specimen.

**Table S2:** Data used to evaluate the influence, environment and contact zone on the morphological variability of M. manacus in Colombia. The data is presented as a separate excel file in which we provide information about phenotype (white or yellow), sex, source of information (museum or mist net), Voucher ID in case the information corresponded to a museum specimen, longitude and latitidue in decimal degrees of the locality where the individual was collected, raw measurements for Body Mass, Wing, Tail and Culmen length, scores for the first three principal components constructed using morphological data and climatic information for the locality in which the specimen was collected. mPC1, mPC2 and mPC3 correspond to the scores of the principal components constructed using morphological data and cPC1, cPC2, cPC3 and cPC4 correspond to scores of the principal components constructed with the climatic data. Bio1 (Annual Mean Temperature), bio3 (Isothermality), bio7 (Temperature Annual Range), bio 12 (Annual Precipitation), bio15 (Precipitation Seasonality) and bio18 (Precipitation of Warmest Quarter) correspond to worldclim variables available at www.worlclim.org.

**Table S3:**  Records of M. manacus obtained from the GBIF data base used to construct the environmental niche model to obtain least cost path distances between localities

**Supplementary methods:** PCoA as a surrogate for isolation by distance.
